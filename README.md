# VCV Module Ideas
A place to discuss future VCV module ideas

No code can be found here, just used for the issue features provided while discussing future module ideas. Once the inital discussion has progressed enough for the module to be coded, it shall be presented as a experimental branch on the main repo.

All are welcome to comment.

I have added some template svg files and symbols for inkscape, that can be used when producing mock ui's in the res/ folder
